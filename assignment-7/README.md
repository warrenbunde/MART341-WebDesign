Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?

I have interacted with a variety of different types of forms across the internet from job applications,
online quizzes for class or requiring information for the site provider.  They serve as a functional
and efficient tool when used effectively.  The form serves like a messenger tube in the drive thru at a
bank.  Only can fit in so much information before overloading the user or the system so an important
aspect when designing a interactive form is simplicity.
