A browser is a users link to the internet.  The user inputs the intended
website where the data request is sent to a server which has all the data
necessary to open the website. .html, .css, images, links, etcs and the
browser translates all that information into the rendered website for the user
to interact with.

I use firefox and Google Chrome
