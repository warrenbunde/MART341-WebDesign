1. A directory is a pathway or roadmap for programing file locations or digital file cabinet.

2. VCS or version control system are useful because it allows a web design/developer to create and 
track new content with a timestamp and added/substracted changes.  You can go back to older version 
if new development doesn't work or contains errors.  When working as a team, the group has the ability 
to see who made changes and when they were made.  

3. I enjoy using any medium that involves using my hands or mentially stimulating over problem-solving. 
Currently, I am working in oil paints, sculpture, and ceramics.
